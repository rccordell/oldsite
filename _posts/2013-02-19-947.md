Last week I gave a talk about my current research, "Mapping Networks of Viral Texts in Nineteenth-Century America" for Southern Methodist University's <a href="http://www.smu.edu/Dedman/DCII">Dedman College Interdisciplinary Institute</a>. They were kind enough to record and post video of the talk.

The video isn't super-high-resolution, so you can also access my slides on Prezi.
