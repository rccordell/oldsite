<em>Cross-posted from my "Hawthorne's Celestial Railroad: A Publication History" development blog at http://ryan.cordells.us/crr/hawthorne-article-published-at-dhq/</em><br>
<p>While I apologize for the slow updates here of late, I am pleased to report that my article on the reprinting history of &#8220;The Celestial Railroad&#8221; has been published in the <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000144/000144.html">latest issue of <em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em></a>. This is a special issue on &#8220;The Literary,&#8221; and is well worth perusing in full.</p>
