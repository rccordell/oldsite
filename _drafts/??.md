I'm in the midst of my tenure year, which has led me to be more reflective and introspective than I imagined it would. Facing a tenure decision squarely and up close, I've found myself dwelling on big, possibly intractable questions about location, permanence, work, and fulfillment. I don't think my position or introspections are unique. If anything, as a white man working in academia my own experiences are likely more commonplace than they should be. 

In a class on the economics of print production in the hand-press period, I was introduced to this triangle, which I have since learned is a common image in business circles:
