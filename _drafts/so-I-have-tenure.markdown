On May 2—for me, because I'm currently in New Zealand and Australia—I learned that [I have been recommended for tenure and promotion](https://twitter.com/ryancordell/status/991407289008406528) at Northeastern University. This was certainly welcome and deeply gratifying news: the milestone to which I have been working, arguably, for more than a decade. In the current academic climate, however, it is a sobering milestone as well. The casualization of academic labor continues unabated, and indeed seems to accelerate year after year. Legislatures and [college presidents alike](http://missoulanews.com/news/um-launches-a-strategy-for-distinction-it-s-mostly-cuts/article_7f33288e-433c-11e8-9c06-fb9e845f523d.html) seem intent on disappearing whole swathes of American universities, particularly their humanities, whether because they falsely believe [free speech is in crisis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/03/16/the-campus-free-speech-crisis-is-a-myth-here-are-the-facts/?utm_term=.aecca5304878) or because they falsely believe [humanities majors are economic mistakes](http://ryancordell.org/personal/english-major-jokes/). On cynical days, I worry that my generation of scholars will be the last to enjoy relative academic freedom, or to remember the university as something more than vocational training. Even on my optimistic days, I try to remember that as a tenured faculty member at a private American university, I am privileged well beyond what I deserve—meritocracy myths notwithstanding—and in ways I should seek to extend to others, including those working outside the tenure track at my own institution.

Despite these much bigger issues roiling, however, there are a few smaller but important points I want to make at this moment. I was hired at Northeastern under a cluster hire in the digital humanities, and I was the first member of our English or History departments to apply for tenure and promotion with a digital humanities dossier. Though I am co-author of [a book in progress](https://manifold.umn.edu/project/going-the-rounds), that book was not the centerpiece—or even a substantial part—of my tenure dossier, which was instead comprised articles, grants, and digital projects. From the moment I started at Northeastern, I took part in a series of conversations with my chairs, deans, and others in our administration about what my dossier would include, and why projects such as [*Viral Texts*](http://viraltexts.org) should be weighed as primary scholarly outputs rather than *only* as vehicles for other forms of publication. In these conversations I was buttressed by the work of so many colleagues who developed guidelines for evaluating digital scholarship for [the MLA](https://www.mla.org/About-Us/Governance/Committees/Committee-Listings/Professional-Issues/Committee-on-Information-Technology/Guidelines-for-Evaluating-Work-in-Digital-Humanities-and-Digital-Media) and [the AHA](https://www.historians.org/teaching-and-learning/digital-history-resources/evaluation-of-digital-scholarship-in-history/guidelines-for-the-professional-evaluation-of-digital-scholarship-by-historians), as well as by my dean and department who encouraged and took on a revision of our local tenure guidelines so they would better reflect the possibilities of digital scholarship.

Essentially, however, I did not have to do double the work—write a stellar book *and* develop a substantial digital project—in order to meet my department's tenure and promotion guidelines. Some might see this fact as another example of the humanities' erosion, but I see it as evidence that the hard work of so many over the past decades has in fact borne fruit, and that a more humane assessment of digital scholarship is becoming possible. In fact, even after we signed our book contract for *Going the Rounds*, it was important to me that the book in progress not be central to my tenure dossier, because I wanted my dossier—the dossier my university worked with me to make possible—to also help make such dossiers possible for scholars coming after me, whether at Northeastern or beyond. In [my teaching, research, and service statements](http://ryancordell.org/statements) I tried to discuss my DH work as naturalized and necessary, weaving it throughout my statements without calling it out *too* explicitly as anything other than ["a semi-normal thing"](https://tedunderwood.com/2017/03/30/digital-humanities-as-a-semi-normal-thing/). It was important to me that my projects and collaborative work not require special pleading, but instead that they prove the urgency of my case.

I published [my dossier statements](http://ryancordell.org/statements) on this blog so that other scholars can use them as models, and I volunteer any of my other materials for such use. **I mean it**: if you are a scholar (particularly, but not exclusively, working in DH) and you would benefit from a model for a T&P dossier, a yearly merit evaluation document, or something else along those lines, [email me](mailto:r.cordell@northeastern.edu) and I will send you any or all of my materials for your reference. Beyond templates, if you would benefit from advice about how to talk about your DH work or teaching in these contexts, I am happy to offer what advice I can in a brief phone call or Skype chat. I was fortunate to learn from models such as [Amy Earhart](https://twitter.com/amyeetx?lang=en) and [Sharon Leon](https://twitter.com/sharonmleon?lang=en), among many others, and I will gladly pay their generosity forward.
