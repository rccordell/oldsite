For the past few weeks, the digital humanities and anti-digital humanities corners of academia have been debating Nan Z. Da's *Critical Inquiry* article ["The Computational Case against Computational Literary Studies"](https://doi.org/10.1086/702594) and its *Chronicle of Higher Education* companion, ["The Digital Humanities Debacle"](https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Digital-Humanities-Debacle/245986). As [I tweeted](https://twitter.com/ryancordell/status/1106192285887328257) early in this discussion, I am overall glad to see this contribution to the field Da calls "computational literary studies." I wrote then that Da's piece "should become an important touchstone for scholars in the field and its critics," because it "engages substantively with the data" and the specific set of statistical methods it questions. It does so without making computational text analysis a metonym for the entire set of methods grouped under digital humanities, as is common in less nuanced broadsides. In some ways the specificity I appreciated about the original article was undermined by whoever titled the *Chronicle* companion—and I recognize that may well not have been Da—and reiterated the metonymy that collapses the entire field into [the black hole of Franco Moretti](https://ryancordell.org/research/dh/on-ignoring-encoding/).
